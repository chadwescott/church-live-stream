                <p>Rejoice always. Pray without ceasing.
                    In all circumstances give thanks,
                    for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.
                    Do not quench the Spirit.
                    Do not despise prophetic utterances.
                    Test everything; retain what is good.
                    Refrain from every kind of evil.

                    May the God of peace make you perfectly holy
                    and may you entirely, spirit, soul, and body,
                    be preserved blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
                    The one who calls you is faithful,
                    and he will also accomplish it.</p>
