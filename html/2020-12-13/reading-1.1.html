                <p>The spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me,
                    because the LORD has anointed me;
                    he has sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor,
                    to heal the brokenhearted,
                    to proclaim liberty to the captives
                    and release to the prisoners,
                    to announce a year of favor from the LORD
                    and a day of vindication by our God.

                    I rejoice heartily in the LORD,
                    in my God is the joy of my soul;
                    for he has clothed me with a robe of salvation
                    and wrapped me in a mantle of justice,
                    like a bridegroom adorned with a diadem,
                    like a bride bedecked with her jewels.</p>
