                <p>A man named John was sent from God.
                    He came for testimony, to testify to the light,
                    so that all might believe through him.
                    He was not the light,
                    but came to testify to the light.

                    And this is the testimony of John.
                    When the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests
                    and Levites to him
                    to ask him, “Who are you?”
                    He admitted and did not deny it,
                    but admitted, “I am not the Christ.”
                    So they asked him,
                    “What are you then? Are you Elijah?”
                    And he said, “I am not.”</p>
