            <p>Now Simon Peter was standing there keeping warm.
                And they said to him,
                “You are not one of his disciples, are you?”
                He denied it and said,
                “I am not.”
                One of the slaves of the high priest,
                a relative of the one whose ear Peter had cut off, said,
                “Didn’t I see you in the garden with him?”
                Again Peter denied it.
                And immediately the cock crowed.</p>
            <p>Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium.
                It was morning.
                And they themselves did not enter the praetorium,</p>
