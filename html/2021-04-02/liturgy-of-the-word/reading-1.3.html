            <p>whole,
                by his stripes we were healed.
                We had all gone astray like sheep,
                each following his own way;
                but the LORD laid upon him
                the guilt of us all.</p>
            <p>Though he was harshly treated, he submitted
                and opened not his mouth;
                like a lamb led to the slaughter
                or a sheep before the shearers,
                he was silent and opened not his mouth.
                Oppressed and condemned, he was taken away,
                and who would have thought any more of his destiny?
                When he was cut off from the land of the living,</p>
