            <p>For all my foes I am an object of reproach,
                a laughingstock to my neighbors, and a dread to my friends;
                they who see me abroad flee from me.
                I am forgotten like the unremembered dead;
                I am like a dish that is broken.</p>
            <p class="prayer__response">Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.</p>
            <p>But my trust is in you, O LORD;
                I say, “You are my God.
                In your hands is my destiny; rescue me
                from the clutches of my enemies and my persecutors.”</p>
