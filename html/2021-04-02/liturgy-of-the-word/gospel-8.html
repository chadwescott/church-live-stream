            <p>“Are you the King of the Jews?”
                Jesus answered,
                “Do you say this on your own
                or have others told you about me?”
                Pilate answered,
                “I am not a Jew, am I?
                Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me.
                What have you done?”
                Jesus answered,
                “My kingdom does not belong to this world.
                If my kingdom did belong to this world,
                my attendants would be fighting
                to keep me from being handed over to the Jews.
                But as it is, my kingdom is not here.”
                So Pilate said to him,
                “Then you are a king?”</p>
