            <p>Jesus answered him,
                “I have spoken publicly to the world.
                I have always taught in a synagogue
                or in the temple area where all the Jews gather,
                and in secret I have said nothing. Why ask me?
                Ask those who heard me what I said to them.
                They know what I said.”
                When he had said this,
                one of the temple guards standing there struck Jesus and said,
                “Is this the way you answer the high priest?”
                Jesus answered him,
                “If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong;
                but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?”
                Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</p>
