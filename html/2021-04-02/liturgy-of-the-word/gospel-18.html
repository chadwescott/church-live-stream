            <p>and then of the other one who was crucified with Jesus.
                But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead,
                they did not break his legs,
                but one soldier thrust his lance into his side,
                and immediately blood and water flowed out.
                An eyewitness has testified, and his testimony is true;
                he knows that he is speaking the truth,
                so that you also may come to believe.
                For this happened so that the Scripture passage might be fulfilled:
                <span class="prayer--verse">Not a bone of it will be broken.</span>
                And again another passage says:
                <span class="prayer--verse">They will look upon him whom they have pierced.</span>
