            <p>See, my servant shall prosper,
                he shall be raised high and greatly exalted.
                Even as many were amazed at him --
                so marred was his look beyond human semblance
                and his appearance beyond that of the sons of man--
                so shall he startle many nations,
                because of him kings shall stand speechless;
                for those who have not been told shall see,
                those who have not heard shall ponder it.</p>
            <p>Who would believe what we have heard?
                To whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?</p>
