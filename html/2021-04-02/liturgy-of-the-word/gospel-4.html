            <p>But Peter stood at the gate outside.
                So the other disciple, the acquaintance of the high priest,
                went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter in.
                Then the maid who was the gatekeeper said to Peter,
                “You are not one of this man’s disciples, are you?”
                He said, “I am not.”
                Now the slaves and the guards were standing around a charcoal fire
                that they had made, because it was cold,
                and were warming themselves.
                Peter was also standing there keeping warm.</p>
            <p>The high priest questioned Jesus
                about his disciples and about his doctrine.</p>
