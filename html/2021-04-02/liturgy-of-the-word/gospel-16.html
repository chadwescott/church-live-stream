            <p>Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother
                and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas,
                and Mary of Magdala.
                When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved
                he said to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son.”
                Then he said to the disciple,
                “Behold, your mother.”
                And from that hour the disciple took her into his home.</p>
            <p>After this, aware that everything was now finished,
                in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled,
                Jesus said, “I thirst.”
                There was a vessel filled with common wine.</p>
