            <p>himself,
                he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull,
                in Hebrew, Golgotha.
                There they crucified him, and with him two others,
                one on either side, with Jesus in the middle.
                Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross.
                It read,
                “Jesus the Nazorean, the King of the Jews.”
                Now many of the Jews read this inscription,
                because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city;
                and it was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
                So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate,
                “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’
                but that he said, ‘I am the King of the Jews’.”</p>
