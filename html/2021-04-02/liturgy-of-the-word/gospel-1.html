            <p>Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron valley
                to where there was a garden,
                into which he and his disciples entered.
                Judas his betrayer also knew the place,
                because Jesus had often met there with his disciples.
                So Judas got a band of soldiers and guards
                from the chief priests and the Pharisees
                and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
                Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen to him,
                went out and said to them, “Whom are you looking for?”</p>
