            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                Since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens,
                Jesus, the Son of God,
                let us hold fast to our confession.
                For we do not have a high priest
                who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses,
                but one who has similarly been tested in every way,
                yet without sin.
                So let us confidently approach the throne of grace
                to receive mercy and to find grace for timely help.</p>
