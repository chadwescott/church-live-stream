            <p>In the days when Christ was in the flesh,
                he offered prayers and supplications with loud cries and tears
                to the one who was able to save him from death,
                and he was heard because of his reverence.
                Son though he was, he learned obedience from what he suffered;
                and when he was made perfect,
                he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.</p>
