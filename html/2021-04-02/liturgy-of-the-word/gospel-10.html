            <p>“Not this one but Barabbas!”
                Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.</p>
            <p>Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged.
                And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head,
                and clothed him in a purple cloak,
                and they came to him and said,
                “Hail, King of the Jews!”
                And they struck him repeatedly.
                Once more Pilate went out and said to them,
                “Look, I am bringing him out to you,
                so that you may know that I find no guilt in him.”
                So Jesus came out,
                wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak.
                And he said to them, “Behold, the man!”</p>
