            <p>Jesus answered,
                “You say I am a king.
                For this I was born and for this I came into the world,
                to testify to the truth.
                Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.”
                Pilate said to him, “What is truth?”</p>
            <p>When he had said this,
                he again went out to the Jews and said to them,
                “I find no guilt in him.
                But you have a custom that I release one prisoner to you at Passover.
                Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?”
                They cried out again,</p>
