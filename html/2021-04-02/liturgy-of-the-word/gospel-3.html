            <p>So the band of soldiers, the tribune, and the Jewish guards seized Jesus,
                bound him, and brought him to Annas first.
                He was the father-in-law of Caiaphas,
                who was high priest that year.
                It was Caiaphas who had counseled the Jews
                that it was better that one man should die rather than the people.</p>
            <p>Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus.
                Now the other disciple was known to the high priest,
                and he entered the courtyard of the high priest with Jesus.</p>
