            <p>Pilate answered,
                “What I have written, I have written.”</p>
            <p>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus,
                they took his clothes and divided them into four shares,
                a share for each soldier.
                They also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless,
                woven in one piece from the top down.
                So they said to one another,
                “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be, “
                in order that the passage of Scripture might be fulfilled that says:
                <span class="prayer--verse">They divided my garments among them,
                    and for my vesture they cast lots.</span>
                This is what the soldiers did.
