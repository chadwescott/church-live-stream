            <p>Precious in the eyes of the LORD
                is the death of his faithful ones.
                I am your servant, the son of your handmaid;
                you have loosed my bonds.</p>

            <p>To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving,
                and I will call upon the name of the LORD.
                My vows to the LORD I will pay
                in the presence of all his people.</p>
