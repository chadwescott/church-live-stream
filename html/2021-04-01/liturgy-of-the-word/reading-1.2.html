            <p>partake of it.
                The lamb must be a year-old male and without blemish.
                You may take it from either the sheep or the goats.
                You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this month,
                and then, with the whole assembly of Israel present,
                it shall be slaughtered during the evening twilight.
                They shall take some of its blood
                and apply it to the two doorposts and the lintel
                of every house in which they partake of the lamb.
                That same night they shall eat its roasted flesh
                with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</p>
