            <p>have his feet washed,
                for he is clean all over;
                so you are clean, but not all.”
                For he knew who would betray him;
                for this reason, he said, “Not all of you are clean.”</p>
            <p>So when he had washed their feet
                and put his garments back on and reclined at table again,
                he said to them, “Do you realize what I have done for you?
                You call me ‘teacher’ and ‘master,’ and rightly so, for indeed I am.
                If I, therefore, the master and teacher, have washed your feet,
                you ought to wash one another’s feet.
                I have given you a model to follow,</p>
