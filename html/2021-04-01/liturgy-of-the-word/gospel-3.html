            <p>Jesus answered and said,
                “This voice did not come for my sake but for yours.
                Now is the time of judgment on this world;
                now the ruler of this world will be driven out.
                And when I am lifted up from the earth,
                I will draw everyone to myself.”
                He said this indicating the kind of death he would die.
