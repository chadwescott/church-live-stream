            <p>but if it dies, it produces much fruit.
                Whoever loves his life loses it,
                and whoever hates his life in this world
                will preserve it for eternal life.
                Whoever serves me must follow me,
                and where I am, there also will my servant be.
                The Father will honor whoever serves me.</p>
            <p>“I am troubled now. Yet what should I say?
                ‘Father, save me from this hour’?
                But it was for this purpose that I came to this hour.
                Father, glorify your name.”
                Then a voice came from heaven,
                “I have glorified it and will glorify it again.”
                The crowd there heard it and said it was thunder;
                but others said, “An angel has spoken to him.”</p>
