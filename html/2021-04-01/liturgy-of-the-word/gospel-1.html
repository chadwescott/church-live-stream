            <p>Before the feast of Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come
                to pass from this world to the Father.
                He loved his own in the world and he loved them to the end.
                The devil had already induced Judas, son of Simon the Iscariot, to hand him over.
                So, during supper,
                fully aware that the Father had put everything into his power
                and that he had come from God and was returning to God,
                he rose from supper and took off his outer garments.
                He took a towel and tied it around his waist.</p>
