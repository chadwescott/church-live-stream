            <p>Christ Jesus, though he was in the form of God,
                did not regard equality with God
                something to be grasped.
                Rather, he emptied himself,
                taking the form of a slave,
                coming in human likeness;
                and found human in appearance,
                he humbled himself,
                becoming obedient to the point of death,
                even death on a cross.
                Because of this, God greatly exalted him
                and bestowed on him the name
                which is above every name,
                that at the name of Jesus</p>
