            <p>The Lord GOD has given me
                a well-trained tongue,
                that I might know how to speak to the weary
                a word that will rouse them.
                Morning after morning
                he opens my ear that I may hear;
                and I have not rebelled,
                have not turned back.
                I gave my back to those who beat me,
                my cheeks to those who plucked my beard;
                my face I did not shield
                from buffets and spitting.</p>
            <p>The Lord GOD is my help,
                therefore I am not disgraced;</p>
