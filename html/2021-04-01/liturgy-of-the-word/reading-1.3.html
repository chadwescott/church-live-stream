            <p>“This is how you are to eat it:
                with your loins girt, sandals on your feet and your staff in hand,
                you shall eat like those who are in flight.
                It is the Passover of the LORD.
                For on this same night I will go through Egypt,
                striking down every firstborn of the land, both man and beast,
                and executing judgment on all the gods of Egypt—I, the LORD!
                But the blood will mark the houses where you are.
                Seeing the blood, I will pass over you;
                thus, when I strike the land of Egypt,
                no destructive blow will come upon you.</p>
            <p>“This day shall be a memorial feast for you,
                which all your generations shall celebrate</p>
