                <p>Brothers and sisters:
                    Grace to you and peace from God our Father
                    and the Lord Jesus Christ.

                    I give thanks to my God always on your account
                    for the grace of God bestowed on you in Christ Jesus,
                    that in him you were enriched in every way,
                    with all discourse and all knowledge,
                    as the testimony to Christ was confirmed among you,
                    so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift
                    as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.
                    He will keep you firm to the end,</p>
