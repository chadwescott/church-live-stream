                    Who art in Heaven,
                    hallowed be Thy name;
                    Thy Kingdom come,
                    Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven.
                    Give us this day our daily bread;
                    and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us;
                    and lead us not into temptation,
                    but deliver us from evil.</p>
