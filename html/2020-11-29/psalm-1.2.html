                <p>Once again, O LORD of hosts,
                    look down from heaven, and see;
                    take care of this vine,
                    and protect what your right hand has planted
                    the son of man whom you yourself made strong.</p>
                <p class="prayer__response">Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face and we shall be saved.</p>
                <p>May your help be with the man of your right hand,
                    with the son of man whom you yourself made strong.
                    Then we will no more withdraw from you;
                    give us new life, and we will call upon your name.</p>
                <p class="prayer__response">Lord, make us turn to you; let us see your face and we shall be saved.</p>
