            <p>We are at 25% of our CMA goal. If you have not mailed in your pledge yet, please do so. Everyone’s
                help is needed in order to meet our goal.</p>
            <p>The decision has been made to postpone our outdoor Christmas event for families until Sunday,
                December 13 since we will still be in the orange zone next weekend. Please be sure to register as
                soon as possible for planning purposes.</p>
            <p>It’s still not too late to get your SOS Daily Cash Raffle tickets. They can be picked up in the
                church entrance and in the parish office during office hours.</p>
