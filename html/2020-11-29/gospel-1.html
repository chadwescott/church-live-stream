                <p>Jesus said to his disciples:
                    â€œBe watchful! Be alert!
                    You do not know when the time will come.
                    It is like a man traveling abroad.
                    He leaves home and places his servants in charge,
                    each with his own work,
                    and orders the gatekeeper to be on the watch.
                    Watch, therefore;
                    you do not know when the Lord of the house is coming,
                    whether in the evening, or at midnight,
                    or at cockcrow, or in the morning.
                    May he not come suddenly and find you sleeping.</p>
