                <p>You, LORD, are our father,
                    our redeemer you are named forever.
                    Why do you let us wander, O LORD, from your ways,
                    and harden our hearts so that we fear you not?
                    Return for the sake of your servants,
                    the tribes of your heritage.
                    Oh, that you would rend the heavens and come down,
                    with the mountains quaking before you,
                    while you wrought awesome deeds we could not hope for,
                    such as they had not heard of from of old.
                    No ear has ever heard, no eye ever seen,
                    any God but you</p>
