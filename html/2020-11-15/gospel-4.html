                <p>Should you not then have put my money in the bank
                    so that I could have got it back with interest on my return?
                    Now then! Take the talent from him and give it to the one with ten.
                    For to everyone who has,
                    more will be given and he will grow rich;
                    but from the one who has not,
                    even what he has will be taken away.
                    And throw this useless servant into the darkness outside,
                    where there will be wailing and grinding of teeth.'"</p>
