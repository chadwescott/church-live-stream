                <p>See, I have made two more.'
                    His master said to him, 'Well done, my good and faithful servant.
                    Since you were faithful in small matters,
                    I will give you great responsibilities.
                    Come, share your master's joy.â€™
                    Then the one who had received the one talent came forward and said,
                    'Master, I knew you were a demanding person,
                    harvesting where you did not plant
                    and gathering where you did not scatter;
                    so out of fear I went off and buried your talent in the ground.
                    Here it is back.'
                    His master said to him in reply, 'You wicked, lazy servant!
                    So you knew that I harvest where I did not plant
                    and gather where I did not scatter?</p>
