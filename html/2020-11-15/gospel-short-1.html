                <p>Jesus told his disciples this parable:
                    "A man going on a journey
                    called in his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
                    To one he gave five talents; to another, two; to a third, one--
                    to each according to his ability.
                    Then he went away.

                    "After a long time
                    the master of those servants came back
                    and settled accounts with them.
                    The one who had received five talents came forward
                    bringing the additional five.</p>
