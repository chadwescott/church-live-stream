                    "A man going on a journey
                    called in his servants and entrusted his possessions to them.
                    To one he gave five talents; to another, two; to a third, one--
                    to each according to his ability.
                    Then he went away.
                    Immediately the one who received five talents went and traded with them,
                    and made another five.
                    Likewise, the one who received two made another two.
                    But the man who received one went off and dug a hole in the ground</div>
