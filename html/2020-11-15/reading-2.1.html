                <p>Concerning times and seasons, brothers and sisters,
                    you have no need for anything to be written to you.
                    For you yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come
                    like a thief at night.
                    When people are saying, "Peace and security,"
                    then sudden disaster comes upon them,
                    like labor pains upon a pregnant woman,
                    and they will not escape.

                    But you, brothers and sisters, are not in darkness,
                    for that day to overtake you like a thief.</p>
