                <p>We are grateful to everyone who have kept their weekly offerings current and pray that you continue
                    to do so. In order for us to resume our ministries and programs upon reopening, we need everyone to
                    contribute to our Sunday offering.</p>
                <p>Sunday envelopes and food donations can be dropped off outside the parish life center on Mondays,
                    Wednesdays and Thursdays from 9-12. The food cupboard is open and in need of donations. Please check
                    our bulletin for the needed item of the week.</p>
                <p>Please do not drop off bottles/cans until further notice.</p>
                <p>Theoâ€™s Closet is closed until further notice. Clothing donations made be put in the St. Pauly Shed in
