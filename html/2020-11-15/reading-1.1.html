                <p>When one finds a worthy wife,
                    her value is far beyond pearls.
                    Her husband, entrusting his heart to her,
                    has an unfailing prize.
                    She brings him good, and not evil,
                    all the days of her life.
                    She obtains wool and flax
                    and works with loving hands.
                    She puts her hands to the distaff,
                    and her fingers ply the spindle.
                    She reaches out her hands to the poor,
                    and extends her arms to the needy.
                    Charm is deceptive and beauty fleeting;
                    the woman who fears the LORD is to be praised.
                    Give her a reward for her labors,</p>
