                <p>Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled.

                    "There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars,
                    and on earth nations will be in dismay,
                    perplexed by the roaring of the sea and the waves.
                    People will die of fright
                    in anticipation of what is coming upon the world,
                    for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.
                    And then they will see the Son of Man
                    coming in a cloud with power and great glory.
                    But when these signs begin to happen,
                    stand erect and raise your heads
                    because your redemption is at hand.‚Äù</p>
