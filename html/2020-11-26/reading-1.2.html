                <p>“With such force will Babylon the great city be thrown down,
                    and will never be found again.
                    No melodies of harpists and musicians,
                    flutists and trumpeters,
                    will ever be heard in you again.
                    No craftsmen in any trade
                    will ever be found in you again.
                    No sound of the millstone
                    will ever be heard in you again.
                    No light from a lamp
                    will ever be seen in you again.
                    No voices of bride and groom
                    will ever be heard in you again.
                    Because your merchants were the great ones of the world,
                    all nations were led astray by your magic potion.”</p>
