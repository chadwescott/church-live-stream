            <p>O Jesus, you place on my forehead
                the sign of your saving Cross:
                “Turn from sin and be faithful to the gospel.”</p>
            <p>How can I turn from sin unless I turn to you?</p>
            <p>You speak, you raise your hand,
                You touch my mind and call my name.
                “Turn to the Lord your God again.”</p>
            <p>These days of your favor
                Leave a blessing as you pass on me and all your people
                Turn to us, Lord God, and we shall turn to you.</p>
            <p>Amen.</p>
