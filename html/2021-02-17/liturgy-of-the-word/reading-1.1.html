            <p>Even now, says the LORD,
                return to me with your whole heart,
                with fasting, and weeping, and mourning;
                Rend your hearts, not your garments,
                and return to the LORD, your God.
                For gracious and merciful is he,
                slow to anger, rich in kindness,
                and relenting in punishment.
                Perhaps he will again relent
                and leave behind him a blessing,
                Offerings and libations
                for the LORD, your God.</p>
            <p>Blow the trumpet in Zion!
                proclaim a fast,</p>
