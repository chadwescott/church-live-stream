            <p>so that your almsgiving may be secret.
                And your Father who sees in secret will repay you.</p>
            <p>“When you pray,
                do not be like the hypocrites,
                who love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on street corners
                so that others may see them.
                Amen, I say to you,
                they have received their reward.
                But when you pray, go to your inner room,
                close the door, and pray to your Father in secret.
                And your Father who sees in secret will repay you.</p>
            <p>“When you fast,
                do not look gloomy like the hypocrites.</p>
