            <p>Jesus said to his disciples:
                â€œTake care not to perform righteous deeds
                in order that people may see them;
                otherwise, you will have no recompense from your heavenly Father.
                When you give alms,
                do not blow a trumpet before you,
                as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets
                to win the praise of others.
                Amen, I say to you,
                they have received their reward.
                But when you give alms,
                do not let your left hand know what your right is doing,</p>
