            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                We are ambassadors for Christ,
                as if God were appealing through us.
                We implore you on behalf of Christ,
                be reconciled to God.
                For our sake he made him to be sin who did not know sin,
                so that we might become the righteousness of God in him.</p>
            <p>Working together, then,
                we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
                For he says:</p>
