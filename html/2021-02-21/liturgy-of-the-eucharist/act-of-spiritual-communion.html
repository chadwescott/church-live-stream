            <p>My Jesus,</p>
            <p>I believe that You are present in the Most Holy Sacrament.
                I love You above all things,
                and I desire to receive You into my soul.
                Since I cannot at this moment receive You sacramentally,
                come at least spiritually into my heart.
                I embrace You as if You were already there
                and unite myself wholly to You.
                Never permit me to be separated from You.</p>
            <p>Amen.</p>
