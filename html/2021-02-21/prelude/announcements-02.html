            <p>We are at 67% of our CMA goal. If you have not mailed in your pledge yet, please do so as soon as
                possible. Everyoneâ€™s help is needed in order to meet our goal. Thank you to those who have generously
                given. If you are able to contribute again, we would appreciate it.</p>
            <p>The new SOS Daily Cash Raffle tickets that begin in March are available now. They can be picked up in the
                church entrance, the parish office during office hours and in the chapel entrance.</p>
            <p>We are grateful to everyone who have kept their weekly offerings current and pray that you continue to do
                so. In order for us to resume our ministries and programs upon reopening, we need everyone to contribute
                to our Sunday offering.</p>
