            <p>God said to Noah and to his sons with him:
                “See, I am now establishing my covenant with you
                and your descendants after you
                and with every living creature that was with you:
                all the birds, and the various tame and wild animals
                that were with you and came out of the ark.
                I will establish my covenant with you,
                that never again shall all bodily creatures be destroyed
                by the waters of a flood;
                there shall not be another flood to devastate the earth.”</p>
