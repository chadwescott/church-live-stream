            <p>Beloved:
                Christ suffered for sins once,
                the righteous for the sake of the unrighteous,
                that he might lead you to God.
                Put to death in the flesh,
                he was brought to life in the Spirit.
                In it he also went to preach to the spirits in prison,
                who had once been disobedient
                while God patiently waited in the days of Noah
                during the building of the ark,
                in which a few persons, eight in all,
                were saved through water.
                This prefigured baptism, which saves you now.</p>
