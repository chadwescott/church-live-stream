            <p>God added:
                “This is the sign that I am giving for all ages to come,
                of the covenant between me and you
                and every living creature with you:
                I set my bow in the clouds to serve as a sign
                of the covenant between me and the earth.
                When I bring clouds over the earth,
                and the bow appears in the clouds,
                I will recall the covenant I have made
                between me and you and all living beings,
                so that the waters shall never again become a flood
                to destroy all mortal beings.”</p>
