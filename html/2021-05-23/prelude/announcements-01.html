            <p>Thank you to all who contributed to the CMA last week. We still owe over $7,000. We will need to have
                another collection next week to help make up that goal. If you have not already given, please do so.
                What a great going away gift for Fr. Fred and a wonderful welcome to Fr. McKenna if we can reach our
                goal!!!!!!</p>
            <p>Sunday envelopes and food donations can be dropped off outside the parish life center on Mondays,
                Wednesdays and Thursdays from 9-12.</p>
            <p>Please be sure to read the bulletin for parish information.</p>
