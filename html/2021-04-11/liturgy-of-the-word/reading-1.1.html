            <p>The community of believers was of one heart and mind,
                and no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own,
                but they had everything in common.
                With great power the apostles bore witness
                to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus,
                and great favor was accorded them all.
                There was no needy person among them,
                for those who owned property or houses would sell them,
                bring the proceeds of the sale,
                and put them at the feet of the apostles,
                and they were distributed to each according to need.</p>
