            <p>and see my hands,
                and bring your hand and put it into my side,
                and do not be unbelieving, but believe.”
                Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God!”
                Jesus said to him, “Have you come to believe because you have seen me?
                Blessed are those who have not seen and have believed.”</p>
            <p>Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples
                that are not written in this book.
                But these are written that you may come to believe
                that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,
                and that through this belief you may have life in his name.</p>
