                Who indeed is the victor over the world
                but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
            <p>This is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ,
                not by water alone, but by water and blood.
                The Spirit is the one that testifies,
                and the Spirit is truth.</p>
