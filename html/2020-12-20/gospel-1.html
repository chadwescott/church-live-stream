                <p>The angel Gabriel was sent from God
                    to a town of Galilee called Nazareth,
                    to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph,
                    of the house of David,
                    and the virgin’s name was Mary.
                    And coming to her, he said,
                    “Hail, full of grace! The Lord is with you.”
                    But she was greatly troubled at what was said
                    and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.
                    Then the angel said to her,
                    “Do not be afraid, Mary,
                    for you have found favor with God.

                    “Behold, you will conceive in your womb and
                    bear a son,</p>
