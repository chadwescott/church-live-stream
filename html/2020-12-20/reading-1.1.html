                <p>When King David was settled in his palace,
                    and the LORD had given him rest from his enemies on every side,
                    he said to Nathan the prophet,
                    “Here I am living in a house of cedar,
                    while the ark of God dwells in a tent!”
                    Nathan answered the king,
                    “Go, do whatever you have in mind,
                    for the LORD is with you.”
                    But that night the LORD spoke to Nathan and said:
                    “Go, tell my servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD:
                    Should you build me a house to dwell in?’“

                    "'It was I who took you from the pasture</p>
