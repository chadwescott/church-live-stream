                <p>and you shall name him Jesus.
                    He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High,
                    and the Lord God will give him the throne of David his father,
                    and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever,
                    and of his kingdom there will be no end.”
                    But Mary said to the angel,
                    “How can this be,
                    since I have no relations with a man?”
                    And the angel said to her in reply,
                    “The Holy Spirit will come upon you,
                    and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
                    Therefore the child to be born
                    will be called holy, the Son of God.
                    And behold, Elizabeth, your relative,
                    has also conceived a son in her old age,</p>
