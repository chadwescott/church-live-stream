                <p>and from the care of the flock
                    to be commander of my people Israel.
                    I have been with you wherever you went,
                    and I have destroyed all your enemies before you.
                    And I will make you famous like the great ones of the earth.
                    I will fix a place for my people Israel;
                    I will plant them so that they may dwell in their place
                    without further disturbance.
                    Neither shall the wicked continue to afflict them as they did of old,
                    since the time I first appointed judges over my people Israel.
                    I will give you rest from all your enemies.
                    The LORD also reveals to you
                    that he will establish a house for you.</p>
