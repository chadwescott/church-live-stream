                <p>Brothers and sisters:
                    To him who can strengthen you,
                    according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ,
                    according to the revelation of the mystery kept secret for long ages
                    but now manifested through the prophetic writings and,
                    according to the command of the eternal God,
                    made known to all nations to bring about the obedience of faith,
                    to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ
                    be glory forever and ever.
                    Amen.</p>
