                <p>We are at 36% of our CMA goal. If you have not mailed in your pledge yet, please do so. Everyone’s
                    help is needed in order to meet our goal.</p>
                <p>It’s still not too late to get your SOS Daily Cash Raffle tickets. They can be picked up in the
                    church entrance and in the parish office during office hours.</p>
                <p>We are grateful to everyone who have kept their weekly offerings current and pray that you continue
                    to do so. In order for us to resume our ministries and programs upon reopening, we need everyone to
                    contribute to our Sunday offering.</p>
