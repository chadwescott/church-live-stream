            <p>My children, I am writing this to you
                so that you may not commit sin.
                But if anyone does sin, we have an Advocate with the Father,
                Jesus Christ the righteous one.
                He is expiation for our sins,
                and not for our sins only but for those of the whole world.
                The way we may be sure that we know him is to keep
                his commandments.
                Those who say, “I know him,” but do not keep his commandments
                are liars, and the truth is not in them.
                But whoever keeps his word,</p>
