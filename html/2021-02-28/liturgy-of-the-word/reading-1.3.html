            <p>Again the LORD’s messenger called to Abraham from heaven and said:
                “I swear by myself, declares the LORD,
                that because you acted as you did
                in not withholding from me your beloved son,
                I will bless you abundantly
                and make your descendants as countless
                as the stars of the sky and the sands of the seashore;
                your descendants shall take possession
                of the gates of their enemies,
                and in your descendants all the nations of the earth
                shall find blessing—
                all this because you obeyed my command.”</p>
