            <p>Then a cloud came, casting a shadow over them;
                from the cloud came a voice,
                “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him.”
                Suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone
                but Jesus alone with them.</p>
            <p>As they were coming down from the mountain,
                he charged them not to relate what they had seen to anyone,
                except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
                So they kept the matter to themselves,
                questioning what rising from the dead meant.</p>
