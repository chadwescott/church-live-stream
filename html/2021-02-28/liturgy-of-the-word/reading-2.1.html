            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                If God is for us, who can be against us?
                He who did not spare his own Son
                but handed him over for us all,
                how will he not also give us everything else along with him?</p>
            <p>Who will bring a charge against God’s chosen ones?
                It is God who acquits us, who will condemn?
                Christ Jesus it is who died—or, rather, was raised—
                who also is at the right hand of God,
                who indeed intercedes for us.</p>
