            <p>slaughter his son.
                But the LORD’s messenger called to him from heaven,
                “Abraham, Abraham!”
                “Here I am!” he answered.
                “Do not lay your hand on the boy,” said the messenger.
                “Do not do the least thing to him.
                I know now how devoted you are to God,
                since you did not withhold from me your own beloved son.”
                As Abraham looked about,
                he spied a ram caught by its horns in the thicket.
                So he went and took the ram
                and offered it up as a holocaust in place of his son.</p>
