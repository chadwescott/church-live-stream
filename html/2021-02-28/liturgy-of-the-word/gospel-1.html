            <p>Jesus took Peter, James, and John
                and led them up a high mountain apart by themselves.
                And he was transfigured before them,
                and his clothes became dazzling white,
                such as no fuller on earth could bleach them.
                Then Elijah appeared to them along with Moses,
                and they were conversing with Jesus.
                Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,
                “Rabbi, it is good that we are here!
                Let us make three tents:
                one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”
                He hardly knew what to say, they were so terrified.</p>
