            <p>O LORD, I am your servant;

                you have loosed my bonds.
                To you will I offer sacrifice of thanksgiving,
                and I will call upon the name of the LORD.</p>

                In the courts of the house of the LORD,
                in your midst, O Jerusalem.</p>
