            <p>Along with this livestream Mass, we are celebrating Mass in church with New York Stateâ€™s requirement of
                limited capacity and social distancing. </p>
            <p>The obligation of Mass each week is only temporary. If you are interested in attending a weekend Mass,
                please call the parish office for reservations. You may attend the weekday 8:30 Mass without
                reservation.</p>
            <p>Please check our Facebook page, website, email or office phone message for updates and spread the word to
                others. </p>
