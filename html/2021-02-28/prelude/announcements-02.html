            <p>Our Lenten theme this year is HOPE. Magnets are still available in the church and chapel entrances and in
                the parish office. </p>
            <p>We will be offering a virtual Lenten retreat with Deacon Dennis, Deacon David and Sr. Kate in March.</p>
            <p>We are only at 67% of our CMA goal. Many families still have not given. Everyone needs to contribute in
                order for our parish to make its goal.</p>
            <p>The new SOS Daily Cash Raffle begins in March. Tickets are still available.</p>
