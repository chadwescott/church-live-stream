            <p>Jesus said to his disciples:
                â€œI am the true vine, and my Father is the vine grower.
                He takes away every branch in me that does not bear fruit,
                and every one that does he prunes so that it bears more fruit.
                You are already pruned because of the word that I spoke to you.
                Remain in me, as I remain in you.
                Just as a branch cannot bear fruit on its own
                unless it remains on the vine,
                so neither can you unless you remain in me.
                I am the vine, you are the branches.
                Whoever remains in me and I in him will bear</p>
