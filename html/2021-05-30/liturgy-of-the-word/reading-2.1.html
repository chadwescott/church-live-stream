            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                For those who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
                For you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear,
                but you received a Spirit of adoption,
                through whom we cry, “Abba, Father!”
                The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit
                that we are children of God,
                and if children, then heirs,
                heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ,
                if only we suffer with him
                so that we may also be glorified with him.</p>
