            <p>all of which the LORD, your God,
                did for you in Egypt before your very eyes?
                This is why you must now know,
                and fix in your heart, that the LORD is God
                in the heavens above and on earth below,
                and that there is no other.
                You must keep his statutes and commandments that I enjoin on you today,
                that you and your children after you may prosper,
                and that you may have long life on the land
                which the LORD, your God, is giving you forever.&rdquo;</p>
