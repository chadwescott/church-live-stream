            <p>Moses said to the people:
                &ldquo;Ask now of the days of old, before your time,
                ever since God created man upon the earth;
                ask from one end of the sky to the other:
                Did anything so great ever happen before?
                Was it ever heard of?
                Did a people ever hear the voice of God
                speaking from the midst of fire, as you did, and live?
                Or did any god venture to go and take a nation for himself
                from the midst of another nation,
                by testings, by signs and wonders, by war,
                with strong hand and outstretched arm, and by great terrors,</p>
