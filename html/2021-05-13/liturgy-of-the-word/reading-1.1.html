            <p>In the first book, Theophilus,
                I dealt with all that Jesus did and taught
                until the day he was taken up,
                after giving instructions through the Holy Spirit
                to the apostles whom he had chosen.
                He presented himself alive to them
                by many proofs after he had suffered,
                appearing to them during forty days
                and speaking about the kingdom of God.
                While meeting with them,
                he enjoined them not to depart from Jerusalem,
                but to wait for â€œthe promise of the Father
                about which you have heard me speak;</p>
