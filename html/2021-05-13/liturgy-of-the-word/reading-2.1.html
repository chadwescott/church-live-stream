            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                May the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory,
                give you a Spirit of wisdom and revelation
                resulting in knowledge of him.
                May the eyes of your hearts be enlightened,
                that you may know what is the hope that belongs to his call,
                what are the riches of glory
                in his inheritance among the holy ones,
                and what is the surpassing greatness of his power
                for us who believe,
                in accord with the exercise of his great might,
                which he worked in Christ,</p>
