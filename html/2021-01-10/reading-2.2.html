            <p>And the victory that conquers the world is our faith.
                Who indeed is the victor over the world
                but the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</p>
            <p>This is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ,
                not by water alone, but by water and blood.
                The Spirit is the one who testifies,
                and the Spirit is truth.
                So there are three that testify,
                the Spirit, the water, and the blood,
                and the three are of one accord.
                If we accept human testimony,
                the testimony of God is surely greater.
                Now the testimony of God is this,
                that he has testified on behalf of his Son.</p>
