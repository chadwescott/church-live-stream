            <p>For just as from the heavens
                the rain and snow come down
                and do not return there
                till they have watered the earth,
                making it fertile and fruitful,
                giving seed to the one who sows
                and bread to the one who eats,
                so shall my word be
                that goes forth from my mouth;
                my word shall not return to me void,
                but shall do my will,
                achieving the end for which I sent it.</p>
