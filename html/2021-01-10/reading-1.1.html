            <p>Thus says the LORD:
                All you who are thirsty,
                come to the water!
                You who have no money,
                come, receive grain and eat;
                come, without paying and without cost,
                drink wine and milk!
                Why spend your money for what is not bread,
                your wages for what fails to satisfy?
                Heed me, and you shall eat well,
                you shall delight in rich fare.
                Come to me heedfully,
                listen, that you may have life.
                I will renew with you the everlasting covenant,
                the benefits assured to David.</p>
