            <p>As I made him a witness to the peoples,
                a leader and commander of nations,
                so shall you summon a nation you knew not,
                and nations that knew you not shall run to you,
                because of the LORD, your God,
                the Holy One of Israel, who has glorified you.</p>
            <p>Seek the LORD while he may be found,
                call him while he is near.
                Let the scoundrel forsake his way,
                and the wicked man his thoughts;
                let him turn to the LORD for mercy;
                to our God, who is generous in forgiving.
                For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
                nor are your ways my ways, says the LORD.
                As high as the heavens are above the earth
                so high are my ways above your ways
                and my thoughts above your thoughts.</p>
