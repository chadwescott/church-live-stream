            <p>Come, let us bow down in worship;
                let us kneel before the LORD who made us.
                For he is our God,
                and we are the people he shepherds, the flock he guides.</p>

            <p>Oh, that today you would hear his voice:
                “Harden not your hearts as at Meribah,
                as in the day of Massah in the desert,
                Where your fathers tempted me;
                they tested me though they had seen my works.”</p>
