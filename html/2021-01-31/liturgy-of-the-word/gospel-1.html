            <p>Then they came to Capernaum,
                and on the sabbath Jesus entered the synagogue and taught.
                The people were astonished at his teaching,
                for he taught them as one having authority and not as the scribes.
                In their synagogue was a man with an unclean spirit;
                he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth?
                Have you come to destroy us?
                I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”
                Jesus rebuked him and said,
                “Quiet! Come out of him!”</p>
