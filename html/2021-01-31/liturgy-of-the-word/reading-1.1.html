            <p>Moses spoke to all the people, saying:
                “A prophet like me will the LORD, your God, raise up for you
                from among your own kin;
                to him you shall listen.
                This is exactly what you requested of the LORD, your God, at Horeb
                on the day of the assembly, when you said,
                ‘Let us not again hear the voice of the LORD, our God,
                nor see this great fire any more, lest we die.’
                And the LORD said to me, ‘This was well said.
                I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their kin,</p>
