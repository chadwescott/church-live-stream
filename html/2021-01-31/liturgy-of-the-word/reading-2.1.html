            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                I should like you to be free of anxieties.
                An unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord,
                how he may please the Lord.
                But a married man is anxious about the things of the world,
                how he may please his wife, and he is divided.
                An unmarried woman or a virgin is anxious about the things of the Lord,
                so that she may be holy in both body and spirit.
                A married woman, on the other hand,
                is anxious about the things of the world,
                how she may please her husband.</p>
