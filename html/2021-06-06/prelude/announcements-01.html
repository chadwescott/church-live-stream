            <p>Please share with your family and friends that reservations are no longer needed to attend weekend Mass.
                Since there are no longer assigned seats, you can now choose your Mass time and your seat in either the
                social distancing or no social distancing areas. For the respect of our parish community, masks will
                still be required.</p>
            <p>Beginning this weekend, June 5-6, the obligation to attend Sunday Mass resumes.</p>
            <p>Sunday envelopes and food donations can be dropped off outside the parish life center on Mondays,
                Wednesdays and Thursdays from 9-12. Please be sure to read the bulletin for parish information.</p>
