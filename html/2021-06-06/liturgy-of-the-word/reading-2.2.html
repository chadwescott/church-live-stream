            <p>how much more will the blood of Christ,
                who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God,
                cleanse our consciences from dead works
                to worship the living God.</p>
            <p>For this reason he is mediator of a new covenant:
                since a death has taken place for deliverance
                from transgressions under the first covenant,
                those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance.</p>
