            <p>On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread,
                when they sacrificed the Passover lamb,
                Jesusâ€™ disciples said to him,
                &ldquo;Where do you want us to go
                and prepare for you to eat the Passover?&rdquo;
                He sent two of his disciples and said to them,
                &ldquo;Go into the city and a man will meet you,
                carrying a jar of water.
                Follow him.
                Wherever he enters, say to the master of the house,
                &lsquo;The Teacher says, &ldquo;Where is my guest room
                where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
