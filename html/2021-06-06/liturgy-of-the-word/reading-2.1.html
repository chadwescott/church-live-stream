            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                When Christ came as high priest
                of the good things that have come to be,
                passing through the greater and more perfect tabernacle
                not made by hands, that is, not belonging to this creation,
                he entered once for all into the sanctuary,
                not with the blood of goats and calves
                but with his own blood, thus obtaining eternal redemption.
                For if the blood of goats and bulls
                and the sprinkling of a heifer's ashes
                can sanctify those who are defiled
                so that their flesh is cleansed,</p>
