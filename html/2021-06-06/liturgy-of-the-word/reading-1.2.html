            <p>as peace offerings to the LORD,
                Moses took half of the blood and put it in large bowls;
                the other half he splashed on the altar.
                Taking the book of the covenant, he read it aloud to the people,
                who answered, &ldquo;All that the LORD has said, we will heed and do.&rdquo;
                Then he took the blood and sprinkled it on the people, saying,
                &ldquo;This is the blood of the covenant
                that the LORD has made with you
                in accordance with all these words of his.&rdquo;</p>
