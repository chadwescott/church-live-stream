                The disciples then went off, entered the city,
                and found it just as he had told them;
                and they prepared the Passover.
                While they were eating,
                he took bread, said the blessing,
                broke it, gave it to them, and said,
                &ldquo;Take it; this is my body.&rdquo;
                Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them,
                and they all drank from it.
                He said to them,
                &ldquo;This is my blood of the covenant,
                which will be shed for many.
                Amen, I say to you,
                I shall not drink again the fruit of the vine</p>
