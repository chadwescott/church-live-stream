            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                You have heard of the stewardship of God's grace
                that was given to me for your benefit,
                namely, that the mystery was made known to me by revelation.
                It was not made known to people in other generations
                as it has now been revealed
                to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit:
                that the Gentiles are coheirs, members of the same body,
                and copartners in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</p>
