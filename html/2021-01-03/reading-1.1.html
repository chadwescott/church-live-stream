            <p>Rise up in splendor, Jerusalem! Your light has come,
                the glory of the Lord shines upon you.
                See, darkness covers the earth,
                and thick clouds cover the peoples;
                but upon you the LORD shines,
                and over you appears his glory.
                Nations shall walk by your light,
                and kings by your shining radiance.
                Raise your eyes and look about;
                they all gather and come to you:
                your sons come from afar,
                and your daughters in the arms of their nurses.</p>
