            <p>When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea,
                in the days of King Herod,
                behold, magi from the east arrived in Jerusalem, saying,
                "Where is the newborn king of the Jews?
                We saw his star at its rising
                and have come to do him homage."
                When King Herod heard this,
                he was greatly troubled,
                and all Jerusalem with him.
                Assembling all the chief priests and the scribes of the people,
                He inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</p>
