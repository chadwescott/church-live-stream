            <p>Jesus said to the crowds:
                “This is how it is with the kingdom of God;
                it is as if a man were to scatter seed on the land
                and would sleep and rise night and day
                and through it all the seed would sprout and grow,
                he knows not how.
                Of its own accord the land yields fruit,
                first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.
                And when the grain is ripe, he wields the sickle at once,
                for the harvest has come.”</p>
