        <div class="prayer">
            <p>Job spoke, saying:
                Is not man’s life on earth a drudgery?
                Are not his days those of hirelings?
                He is a slave who longs for the shade,
                a hireling who waits for his wages.
                So I have been assigned months of misery,
                and troubled nights have been allotted to me.
                If in bed I say, “When shall I arise?”
                then the night drags on;
                I am filled with restlessness until the dawn.
                My days are swifter than a weaver’s shuttle;
                they come to an end without hope.
                Remember that my life is like the wind;
                I shall not see happiness again.</p>
