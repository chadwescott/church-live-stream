            <p>Although I am free in regard to all,
                I have made myself a slave to all
                so as to win over as many as possible.
                To the weak I became weak, to win over the weak.
                I have become all things to all, to save at least some.
                All this I do for the sake of the gospel,
                so that I too may have a share in it.</p>
