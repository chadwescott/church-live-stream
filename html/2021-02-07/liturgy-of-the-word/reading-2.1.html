            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                If I preach the gospel, this is no reason for me to boast,
                for an obligation has been imposed on me,
                and woe to me if I do not preach it!
                If I do so willingly, I have a recompense,
                but if unwillingly, then I have been entrusted with a stewardship.
                What then is my recompense?
                That, when I preach,
                I offer the gospel free of charge
                so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.</p>
