                not permitting them to speak because they knew him.</p>
            <p>Rising very early before dawn, he left
                and went off to a deserted place, where he prayed.
                Simon and those who were with him pursued him
                and on finding him said, “Everyone is looking for you.”
                He told them, “Let us go on to the nearby villages
                that I may preach there also.
                For this purpose have I come.”
                So he went into their synagogues,
                preaching and driving out demons throughout the whole of Galilee.</p>
