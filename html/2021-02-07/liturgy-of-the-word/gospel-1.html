            <p>On leaving the synagogue
                Jesus entered the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.
                Simonâ€™s mother-in-law lay sick with a fever.
                They immediately told him about her.
                He approached, grasped her hand, and helped her up.
                Then the fever left her and she waited on them.</p>
            <p>When it was evening, after sunset,
                they brought to him all who were ill or possessed by demons.
                The whole town was gathered at the door.
                He cured many who were sick with various diseases,</p>
