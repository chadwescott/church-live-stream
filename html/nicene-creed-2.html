                <p class="prayer__response continue">of the Virgin Mary,
                    and became man. <em>(End Bow)</em>

                    For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
                    he suffered death and was buried,
                    and rose again on the third day
                    in accordance with the Scriptures.
                    He ascended into heaven
                    and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
                    He will come again in glory
                    to judge the living and the dead
                    and his kingdom will have no end.

                    I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
                    who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
                    who with the Father and the Son is adored</p>
