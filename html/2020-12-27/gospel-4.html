            <p>She never left the temple,
                but worshiped night and day with fasting and prayer.
                And coming forward at that very time,
                she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child
                to all who were awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>When they had fulfilled all the prescriptions
                of the law of the Lord,
                they returned to Galilee,
                to their own town of Nazareth.
                The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom;
                and the favor of God was upon him.</p>
