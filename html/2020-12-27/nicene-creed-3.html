                who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
                who with the Father and the Son is adored
                and glorified,
                who has spoken through the prophets.

                I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
                I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
                and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
                and the life of the world to come. Amen.
