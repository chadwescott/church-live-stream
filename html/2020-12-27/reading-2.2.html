            <p>one body.
                And be thankful.
                Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly,
                as in all wisdom you teach and admonish one another,
                singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs
                with gratitude in your hearts to God.
                And whatever you do, in word or in deed,
                do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus,
                giving thanks to God the Father through him.

                Wives, be subordinate to your husbands,
                as is proper in the Lord.
                Husbands, love your wives,
                and avoid any bitterness toward them.
                Children, obey your parents in everything,
                for this is pleasing to the Lord.</p>
