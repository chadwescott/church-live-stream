            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                Put on, as Godâ€™s chosen ones, holy and beloved,
                heartfelt compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience,
                bearing with one another and forgiving one another,
                if one has a grievance against another;
                as the Lord has forgiven you, so must you also do.
                And over all these put on love,
                that is, the bond of perfection.
                And let the peace of Christ control your hearts,
                the peace into which you were also called in</p>
