            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place
                that he was to receive as an inheritance;
                he went out, not knowing where he was to go.
                By faith he received power to generate,
                even though he was past the normal age
                --and Sarah herself was sterile--
                for he thought that the one who had made the promise was trustworthy.
                So it was that there came forth from one man,
                himself as good as dead,
                descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky</p>
