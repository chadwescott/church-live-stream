                and became man. <em>(End Bow)</em>

                For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
                he suffered death and was buried,
                and rose again on the third day
                in accordance with the Scriptures.
                He ascended into heaven
                and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
                He will come again in glory
                to judge the living and the dead
                and his kingdom will have no end.</p>
