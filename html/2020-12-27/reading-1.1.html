        <div class="prayer">
            <p>God sets a father in honor over his children;
                a motherâ€™s authority he confirms over her sons.
                Whoever honors his father atones for sins,
                and preserves himself from them.
                When he prays, he is heard;
                he stores up riches who reveres his mother.
                Whoever honors his father is gladdened by children,
                and, when he prays, is heard.
                Whoever reveres his father will live a long life;
                he who obeys his father brings comfort to his mother.

                My son, take care of your father when he is old;</p>
