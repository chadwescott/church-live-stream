                <p>The people who walked in darkness
                    have seen a great light;
                    upon those who dwelt in the land of gloom
                    a light has shone.
                    You have brought them abundant joy
                    and great rejoicing,
                    as they rejoice before you as at the harvest,
                    as people make merry when dividing spoils.
                    For the yoke that burdened them,
                    the pole on their shoulder,
                    and the rod of their taskmaster
                    you have smashed, as on the day of Midian.
                    For every boot that tramped in battle,
                    every cloak rolled in blood,
                    will be burned as fuel for flames.</p>
