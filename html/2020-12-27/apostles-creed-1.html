                the Father almighty,
                Creator of heaven and earth,
                and in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord,
                <em>(Bow)</em> who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,
                born of the Virgin Mary, <em>(End Bow)</em>
                suffered under Pontius Pilate,
                was crucified, died and was buried;
                he descended into hell;
                on the third day he rose again from the dead;
                he ascended into heaven,
                and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;
                from there he will come to judge the living and the dead.
