            <p>When the days were completed for their purification
                according to the law of Moses,
                They took him up to Jerusalem
                to present him to the Lord,
                just as it is written in the law of the Lord,
                Every male that opens the womb shall be consecrated to the Lord,
                and to offer the sacrifice of
                a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,
                in accordance with the dictate in the law of the Lord.

                Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon.
                This man was righteous and devout,
                awaiting the consolation of Israel,
                and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
                It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
                that he should not see death
                before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.
                He came in the Spirit into the temple;
                and when the parents brought in the child Jesus
                to perform the custom of the law in regard to him,
                He took him into his arms and blessed God, saying:
                “Now, Master, you may let your servant go
                in peace, according to your word,
                for my eyes have seen your salvation,
                which you prepared in sight of all the peoples,
                a light for revelation to the Gentiles,
                and glory for your people Israel.”
                The child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him;
                and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother,
                “Behold, this child is destined
                for the fall and rise of many in Israel,
                and to be a sign that will be contradicted
                —and you yourself a sword will pierce—
                so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.”
                There was also a prophetess, Anna,
                the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher.
                She was advanced in years,
                having lived seven years with her husband after her marriage,
                and then as a widow until she was eighty-four.
                She never left the temple,
                but worshiped night and day with fasting and prayer.
                And coming forward at that very time,
                she gave thanks to God and spoke about the child
                to all who were awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem.

                When they had fulfilled all the prescriptions
                of the law of the Lord,
                they returned to Galilee,
                to their own town of Nazareth.
                The child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom;
                and the favor of God was upon him.</p>
