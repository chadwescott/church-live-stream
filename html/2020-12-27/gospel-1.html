            <p>When the days were completed for their purification
                according to the law of Moses,
                They took him up to Jerusalem
                to present him to the Lord,
                just as it is written in the law of the Lord,
                Every male that opens the womb shall be consecrated to the Lord,
                and to offer the sacrifice of
                a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons,
                in accordance with the dictate in the law of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon.</p>
