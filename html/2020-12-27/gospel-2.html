            <p>This man was righteous and devout,
                awaiting the consolation of Israel,
                and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
                It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
                that he should not see death
                before he had seen the Christ of the Lord.
                He came in the Spirit into the temple;
                and when the parents brought in the child Jesus
                to perform the custom of the law in regard to him,
                He took him into his arms and blessed God, saying:
                â€œNow, Master, you may let your servant go
                in peace, according to your word,
                for my eyes have seen your salvation,
                which you prepared in sight of all the peoples,
                a light for revelation to the Gentiles,</p>
