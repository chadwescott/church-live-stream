            <p>The LORD said to Moses:
                “Speak to Aaron and his sons and tell them:
                This is how you shall bless the Israelites.
                Say to them:
                The LORD bless you and keep you!
                The LORD let his face shine upon
                you, and be gracious to you!
                The LORD look upon you kindly and
                give you peace!
                So shall they invoke my name upon the Israelites,
                and I will bless them.”</p>
