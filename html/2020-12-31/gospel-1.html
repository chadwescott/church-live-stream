            <p>The shepherds went in haste to Bethlehem and found Mary and Joseph,
                and the infant lying in the manger.
                When they saw this,
                they made known the message
                that had been told them about this child.
                All who heard it were amazed
                by what had been told them by the shepherds.
                And Mary kept all these things,
                reflecting on them in her heart.
                Then the shepherds returned,
                glorifying and praising God
                for all they had heard and seen,
                just as it had been told to them.</p>
