                    and to you, my brothers and sisters,
                    that I have greatly sinned
                    in my thoughts and in my words,
                    in what I have done
                    and in what I have failed to do,
                    <em>(striking breast)</em>
                    through my fault,
                    through my fault,
                    through my most grievous fault;
                    therefore I ask blessed Mary ever-Virgin,
                    all the Angels and Saints,
                    and you, my brothers and sisters,
                    to pray for me to the Lord our God. </div>
