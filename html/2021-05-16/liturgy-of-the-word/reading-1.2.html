            <p>“Therefore, it is necessary that one of the men
                who accompanied us the whole time
                the Lord Jesus came and went among us,
                beginning from the baptism of John
                until the day on which he was taken up from us,
                become with us a witness to his resurrection.”
                So they proposed two, Judas called Barsabbas,
                who was also known as Justus, and Matthias.
                Then they prayed,
                “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all,
                show which one of these two you have chosen
                to take the place in this apostolic ministry
                from which Judas turned away to go to his own place.”</p>
