            <p>because they do not belong to the world
                any more than I belong to the world.
                I do not ask that you take them out of the world
                but that you keep them from the evil one.
                They do not belong to the world
                any more than I belong to the world.
                Consecrate them in the truth. Your word is truth.
                As you sent me into the world,
                so I sent them into the world.
                And I consecrate myself for them,
                so that they also may be consecrated in truth.‚Äù</p>
