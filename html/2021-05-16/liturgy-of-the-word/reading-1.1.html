            <p>Peter stood up in the midst of the brothers
                —there was a group of about one hundred and twenty persons
                in the one place —.
                He said, “My brothers,
                the Scripture had to be fulfilled
                which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand
                through the mouth of David, concerning Judas,
                who was the guide for those who arrested Jesus.
                He was numbered among us
                and was allotted a share in this ministry.</p>
