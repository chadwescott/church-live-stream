            <p>Lifting up his eyes to heaven, Jesus prayed saying:
                â€œHoly Father, keep them in your name that you have given me,
                so that they may be one just as we are one.
                When I was with them I protected them in your name that you gave me,
                and I guarded them, and none of them was lost
                except the son of destruction,
                in order that the Scripture might be fulfilled.
                But now I am coming to you.
                I speak this in the world
                so that they may share my joy completely.
                I gave them your word, and the world hated them,</p>
