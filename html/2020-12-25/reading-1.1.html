                <p>Comfort, give comfort to my people,
                    says your God.
                    Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and proclaim to her
                    that her service is at an end,
                    her guilt is expiated;
                    indeed, she has received from the hand of the LORD
                    double for all her sins.

                    A voice cries out:
                    In the desert prepare the way of the LORD!
                    Make straight in the wasteland a highway for our God!
                    Every valley shall be filled in,
                    every mountain and hill shall be made low;</p>
