                <p>were going out to him
                    and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River
                    as they acknowledged their sins.
                    John was clothed in camel’s hair,
                    with a leather belt around his waist.
                    He fed on locusts and wild honey.
                    And this is what he proclaimed:
                    “One mightier than I is coming after me.
                    I am not worthy to stoop and loosen the thongs of his sandals.
                    I have baptized you with water;
                    he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</p>
