                <p>the time came for her to have her child,
                    and she gave birth to her firstborn son.
                    She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger,
                    because there was no room for them in the inn.

                    Now there were shepherds in that region living in the fields
                    and keeping the night watch over their flock.
                    The angel of the Lord appeared to them
                    and the glory of the Lord shone around them,
                    and they were struck with great fear.
                    The angel said to them,
                    â€œDo not be afraid;
                    for behold, I proclaim to you good news of great joy
                    that will be for all the people.
                    For today in the city of David</p>
