                <p>a savior has been born for you who is Christ and Lord.
                    And this will be a sign for you:
                    you will find an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes
                    and lying in a manger.”
                    And suddenly there was a multitude of the heavenly host with the angel,
                    praising God and saying:
                    “Glory to God in the highest
                    and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.”
