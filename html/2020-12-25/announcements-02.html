                <p>We are at 30% of our CMA goal. If you have not mailed in your pledge yet, please do so. Everyone’s
                    help is needed in order to meet our goal.</p>
                <p>If we are not able to gather for our Christmas event next Sunday, we will change to a drive-by so the
                    children will still receive all their goodies and see St. Nicholas and Santa. Those who registered
                    will be notified with the details.</p>
                <p>The Lights of Love tree will be lit and blessed this weekend. A list of the honorees and donors are
                    inserted in this week’s bulletin.</p>
