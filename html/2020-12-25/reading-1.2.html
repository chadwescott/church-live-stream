                <p>For a child is born to us, a son is given us;
                    upon his shoulder dominion rests.
                    They name him Wonder-Counselor, God-Hero,
                    Father-Forever, Prince of Peace.
                    His dominion is vast
                    and forever peaceful,
                    from Davidâ€™s throne, and over his kingdom,
                    which he confirms and sustains
                    by judgment and justice,
                    both now and forever.
                    The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this!</p>
