                <p>the rugged land shall be made a plain,
                    the rough country, a broad valley.
                    Then the glory of the LORD shall be revealed,
                    and all people shall see it together;
                    for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.

                    Go up on to a high mountain,
                    Zion, herald of glad tidings;
                    cry out at the top of your voice,
                    Jerusalem, herald of good news!
                    Fear not to cry out
                    and say to the cities of Judah:
                    Here is your God!
                    Here comes with power
                    the Lord GOD,
                    who rules by his strong arm;
                    here is his reward with him,
                    his recompense before him.</p>
