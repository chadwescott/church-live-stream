                <p>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus
                    that the whole world should be enrolled.
                    This was the first enrollment,
                    when Quirinius was governor of Syria.
                    So all went to be enrolled, each to his own town.
                    And Joseph too went up from Galilee from the town of Nazareth
                    to Judea, to the city of David that is called Bethlehem,
                    because he was of the house and family of David,
                    to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.
                    While they were there,</p>
