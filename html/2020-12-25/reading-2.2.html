                <p>Since everything is to be dissolved in this way,
                    what sort of persons ought you to be,
                    conducting yourselves in holiness and devotion,
                    waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God,
                    because of which the heavens will be dissolved in flames
                    and the elements melted by fire.
                    But according to his promise
                    we await new heavens and a new earth
                    in which righteousness dwells.
                    Therefore, beloved, since you await these things,
                    be eager to be found without spot or blemish before him, at peace.</p>
