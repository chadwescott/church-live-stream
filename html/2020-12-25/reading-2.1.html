                <p>Beloved:
                    The grace of God has appeared, saving all
                    and training us to reject godless ways and worldly desires
                    and to live temperately, justly, and devoutly in this age,
                    as we await the blessed hope,
                    the appearance of the glory of our great God
                    and savior Jesus Christ,
                    who gave himself for us to deliver us from all lawlessness
                    and to cleanse for himself a people as his own,
                    eager to do what is good.</p>
