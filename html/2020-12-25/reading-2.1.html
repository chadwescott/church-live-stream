                <p>Do not ignore this one fact, beloved,
                    that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years
                    and a thousand years like one day.
                    The Lord does not delay his promise, as some regard “delay,”
                    but he is patient with you,
                    not wishing that any should perish
                    but that all should come to repentance.
                    But the day of the Lord will come like a thief,
                    and then the heavens will pass away with a mighty roar
                    and the elements will be dissolved by fire,
                    and the earth and everything done on it will be found out.</p>
