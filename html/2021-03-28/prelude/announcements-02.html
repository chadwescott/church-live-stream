            <p>Deacon Dennis concludes our virtual retreat this Tuesday. You will have an opportunity to interact with
                him through live chat. The retreat begins at 7:00 p.m. and you can find the link on our Lent 2021 page
                on our website.</p>
            <p>We are having an Easter event for families on March 28. More details and registration information is in
                the bulletin.</p>
            <p>We are only at 72% of our CMA goal. Many families still have not given. Everyone needs to contribute in
                order for our parish to make its goal. If we do not reach our goal, we will need to take the money out
                of our savings. Extra envelopes are available in the parish office.</p>
