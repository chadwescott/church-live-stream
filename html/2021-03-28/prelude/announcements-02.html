            <p>We are only at 73% of our CMA goal. Many families still have not given. Everyone needs to contribute in
                order for our parish to make its goal. If we do not reach our goal, we will need to take the money out
                of our savings. Extra envelopes are available in the church entrance and parish office.</p>
            <p>Sunday envelopes and food donations can be dropped off outside the parish life center on Mondays,
                Wednesdays and Thursdays from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm. </p>
            <p>Please be sure to read the bulletin for parish information.</p>
