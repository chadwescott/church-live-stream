            <p>Indeed, many dogs surround me,
                a pack of evildoers closes in upon me;
                They have pierced my hands and my feet;
                I can count all my bones.</p>
            <p class="prayer__response">My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?</p>
            <p>They divide my garments among them,
                and for my vesture they cast lots.
                But you, O LORD, be not far from me;
                O my help, hasten to aid me.</p>
