            <p>Some Greeks who had come to worship at the Passover Feast
                came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee,
                and asked him, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.”
                Philip went and told Andrew;
                then Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.
                Jesus answered them,
                “The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
                Amen, amen, I say to you,
                unless a grain of wheat falls to the ground and dies,
                it remains just a grain of wheat;</p>
