            <p>When the great crowd that had come to the feast heard
                that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
                they took palm branches and went out to meet him, and cried out:
                “Hosanna!
                “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,
                the king of Israel.”
                Jesus found an ass and sat upon it, as is written:
                Fear no more, O daughter Zion;
                see, your king comes, seated upon an ass’s colt.
                His disciples did not understand this at first,</p>
