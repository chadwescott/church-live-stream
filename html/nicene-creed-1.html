                    the Father almighty,
                    maker of heaven and earth,
                    of all things visible and invisible.

                    I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
                    the Only Begotten Son of God,
                    born of the Father before all ages.
                    God from God, Light from Light,
                    true God from true God,
                    begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
                    through him all things were made.
                    For us men and for our salvation
                    he came down from heaven,
                    <em>(Bow)</em> and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate</p>
