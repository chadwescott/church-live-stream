            <p>The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
                “If someone has on his skin a scab or pustule or blotch
                which appears to be the sore of leprosy,
                he shall be brought to Aaron, the priest,
                or to one of the priests among his descendants.
                If the man is leprous and unclean,
                the priest shall declare him unclean
                by reason of the sore on his head.</p>
            <p>“The one who bears the sore of leprosy
                shall keep his garments rent and his head bare,
                and shall muffle his beard;
                he shall cry out, ‘Unclean, unclean!’
                As long as the sore is on him he shall declare</p>
