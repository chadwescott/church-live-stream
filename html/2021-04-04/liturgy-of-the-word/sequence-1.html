            <p>Christians, to the Paschal Victim
                Offer your thankful praises!
                A Lamb the sheep redeems;
                Christ, who only is sinless,
                Reconciles sinners to the Father.
                Death and life have contended in that combat stupendous:
                The Prince of life, who died, reigns immortal.
                Speak, Mary, declaring
                What you saw, wayfaring.
                “The tomb of Christ, who is living,
                The glory of Jesus’ resurrection;
                Bright angels attesting,
                The shroud and napkin resting.
                Yes, Christ my hope is arisen;</p>
