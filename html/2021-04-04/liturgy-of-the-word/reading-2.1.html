            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                If then you were raised with Christ, seek what is above,
                where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
                Think of what is above, not of what is on earth.
                For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
                When Christ your life appears,
                then you too will appear with him in glory.</p>
