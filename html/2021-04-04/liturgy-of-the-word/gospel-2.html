            <p>he bent down and saw the burial cloths there, but did not go in.
                When Simon Peter arrived after him,
                he went into the tomb and saw the burial cloths there,
                and the cloth that had covered his head,
                not with the burial cloths but rolled up in a separate place.
                Then the other disciple also went in,
                the one who had arrived at the tomb first,
                and he saw and believed.
                For they did not yet understand the Scripture
                that he had to rise from the dead.</p>
