            <p>On the first day of the week,
                Mary of Magdala came to the tomb early in the morning,
                while it was still dark,
                and saw the stone removed from the tomb.
                So she ran and went to Simon Peter
                and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and told them,
                “They have taken the Lord from the tomb,
                and we don’t know where they put him.”
                So Peter and the other disciple went out and came to the tomb.
                They both ran, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter
                and arrived at the tomb first;</p>
