            <p>to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.
                You are my friends if you do what I command you.
                I no longer call you slaves,
                because a slave does not know what his master is doing.
                I have called you friends,
                because I have told you everything I have heard from my Father.
                It was not you who chose me, but I who chose you
                and appointed you to go and bear fruit that will remain,
                so that whatever you ask the Father in my name he may give you.
                This I command you: love one another.”</p>
