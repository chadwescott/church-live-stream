            <p>Jesus said to his disciples:
                “As the Father loves me, so I also love you.
                Remain in my love.
                If you keep my commandments, you will remain in my love,
                just as I have kept my Father’s commandments
                and remain in his love.</p>
            <p>“I have told you this so that my joy may be in you
                and your joy might be complete.
                This is my commandment: love one another as I love you.
                No one has greater love than this,</p>
