            <p>This weekend we will have a second collection in hopes of meeting our CMA goal by May 31. It is the
                intent of the CMA to have all parishioners participate in the campaign. All families in the parish are
                asked to make a gift within their means. The more people that pitch in with this effort, the lighter the
                load will be. If you have not already given, we ask that you do it at this time. If you have already
                given and are able to give more, we would appreciate it.</p>
