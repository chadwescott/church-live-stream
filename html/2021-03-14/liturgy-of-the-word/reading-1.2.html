            <p>until the anger of the LORD against his people was so inflamed
                that there was no remedy.
                Their enemies burnt the house of God,
                tore down the walls of Jerusalem,
                set all its palaces afire,
                and destroyed all its precious objects.
                Those who escaped the sword were carried captive to Babylon,
                where they became servants of the king of the Chaldeans and his sons
                until the kingdom of the Persians came to power.
                All this was to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah:
                â€œUntil the land has retrieved its lost sabbaths,
                during all the time it lies waste it shall have rest</p>
