            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                God, who is rich in mercy,
                because of the great love he had for us,
                even when we were dead in our transgressions,
                brought us to life with Christ — by grace you have been saved —,
                raised us up with him,
                and seated us with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus,
                that in the ages to come
                He might show the immeasurable riches of his grace
                in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus.
                For by grace you have been saved through faith,</p>
