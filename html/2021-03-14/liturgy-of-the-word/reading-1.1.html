            <p>In those days, all the princes of Judah, the priests, and the people
                added infidelity to infidelity,
                practicing all the abominations of the nations
                and polluting the LORDâ€™s temple
                which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.</p>
            <p>Early and often did the LORD, the God of their fathers,
                send his messengers to them,
                for he had compassion on his people and his dwelling place.
                But they mocked the messengers of God,
                despised his warnings, and scoffed at his prophets,</p>
