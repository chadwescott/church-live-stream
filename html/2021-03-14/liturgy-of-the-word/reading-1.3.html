            <p>while seventy years are fulfilled.”</p>
            <p>In the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia,
                in order to fulfill the word of the LORD spoken by Jeremiah,
                the LORD inspired King Cyrus of Persia
                to issue this proclamation throughout his kingdom,
                both by word of mouth and in writing:
                “Thus says Cyrus, king of Persia:
                All the kingdoms of the earth
                the LORD, the God of heaven, has given to me,
                and he has also charged me to build him a house
                in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
                Whoever, therefore, among you belongs to any part of his people,
                let him go up, and may his God be with him!”</p>
