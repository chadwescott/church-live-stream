            <p>him.
                Whoever believes in him will not be condemned,
                but whoever does not believe has already been condemned,
                because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.
                And this is the verdict,
                that the light came into the world,
                but people preferred darkness to light,
                because their works were evil.
                For everyone who does wicked things hates the light
                and does not come toward the light,
                so that his works might not be exposed.
                But whoever lives the truth comes to the light,
                so that his works may be clearly seen as done in God.</p>
