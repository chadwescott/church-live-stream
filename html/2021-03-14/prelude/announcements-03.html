            <p>We are grateful to everyone who have kept their weekly offerings current and pray that you continue to do
                so. In order for us to resume our ministries and programs upon reopening, we need everyone to contribute
                to our Sunday offering.</p>
            <p>Sunday envelopes and food donations can be dropped off at the parish life center on Mondays, Wednesdays
                and Thursdays from 9-12. </p>
            <p>Make sure to read the bulletin or visit our website for suggestions for your Lenten journey.</p>
