                <p>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God.

                    As it is written in Isaiah the prophet:
                    Behold, I am sending my messenger ahead of you;
                    he will prepare your way.
                    A voice of one crying out in the desert:
                    “Prepare the way of the Lord,
                    make straight his paths.”
                    John the Baptist appeared in the desert
                    proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
                    People of the whole Judean countryside
                    and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem</p>
