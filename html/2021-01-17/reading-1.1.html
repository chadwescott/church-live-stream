            <p>Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the LORD
                where the ark of God was.
                The LORD called to Samuel, who answered, “Here I am.”
                Samuel ran to Eli and said, “Here I am. You called me.”
                “I did not call you, “ Eli said. “Go back to sleep.”
                So he went back to sleep.
                Again the LORD called Samuel, who rose and went to Eli.
                “Here I am, “ he said. “You called me.”
                But Eli answered, “I did not call you, my son. Go back to sleep.”</p>
