            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                The body is not for immorality, but for the Lord,
                and the Lord is for the body;
                God raised the Lord and will also raise us by his power.</p>
            <p>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ?
                But whoever is joined to the Lord becomes one Spirit with him.
                Avoid immorality.
                Every other sin a person commits is outside the body,
                but the immoral person sins against his own body.</p>
