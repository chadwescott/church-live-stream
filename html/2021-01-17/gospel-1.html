            <p>John was standing with two of his disciples,
                and as he watched Jesus walk by, he said,
                “Behold, the Lamb of God.”
                The two disciples heard what he said and followed Jesus.
                Jesus turned and saw them following him and said to them,
                “What are you looking for?”
                They said to him, “Rabbi” — which translated means Teacher —,
                “where are you staying?”
                He said to them, “Come, and you will see.”
                So they went and saw where Jesus was staying,
                and they stayed with him that day.</p>
