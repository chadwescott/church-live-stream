            <p>At that time Samuel was not familiar with the LORD,
                because the LORD had not revealed anything to him as yet.
                The LORD called Samuel again, for the third time.
                Getting up and going to Eli, he said, “Here I am. You called me.”
                Then Eli understood that the LORD was calling the youth.
                So he said to Samuel, “Go to sleep, and if you are called, reply,
                Speak, LORD, for your servant is listening.”
                When Samuel went to sleep in his place,
                the LORD came and revealed his presence,
                calling out as before, “Samuel, Samuel!”</p>
