            <p>It was about four in the afternoon.
                Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter,
                was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus.
                He first found his own brother Simon and told him,
                “We have found the Messiah” — which is translated Christ —.
                Then he brought him to Jesus.
                Jesus looked at him and said,
                “You are Simon the son of John;
                you will be called Cephas” — which is translated Peter.</p>
