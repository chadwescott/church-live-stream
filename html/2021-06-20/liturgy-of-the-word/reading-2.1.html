            <p>Brothers and sisters:
                The love of Christ impels us,
                once we have come to the conviction that one died for all;
                therefore, all have died.
                He indeed died for all,
                so that those who live might no longer live for themselves
                but for him who for their sake died and was raised.</p>
            <p>Consequently, from now on we regard no one according to the flesh;
                even if we once knew Christ according to the flesh,</p>
