            <p>The days are coming, says the LORD,
                when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel
                and the house of Judah.
                It will not be like the covenant I made with their fathers
                the day I took them by the hand
                to lead them forth from the land of Egypt;
                for they broke my covenant,
                and I had to show myself their master, says the LORD.
                But this is the covenant that I will make
                with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD.
                I will place my law within them and write it</p>
