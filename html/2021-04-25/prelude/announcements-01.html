            <p>Tickets for our basket raffle must be returned by this Monday, April 19 at noon. Additional tickets are
                available in the church entrance or parish office. The drawing will be Tuesday, April 20.</p>
            <p>We seem to be stuck at 75% of our CMA goal. Many families still have not given. Everyone needs to
                contribute in order for our parish to make its goal. If we do not reach our goal, we will need to take
                the money out of our savings. Extra envelopes are available in the church entrance and parish office.
