            <p>Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said:
                â€œLeaders of the people and elders:
                If we are being examined today
                about a good deed done to a cripple,
                namely, by what means he was saved,
                then all of you and all the people of Israel should know
                that it was in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazorean
                whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead;
                in his name this man stands before you healed.
                He is <em>the stone rejected by you, the builders,
                    which has become the cornerstone.</em>
