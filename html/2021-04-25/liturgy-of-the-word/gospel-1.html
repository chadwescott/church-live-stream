            <p>Jesus said:
                â€œI am the good shepherd.
                A good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
                A hired man, who is not a shepherd
                and whose sheep are not his own,
                sees a wolf coming and leaves the sheep and runs away,
                and the wolf catches and scatters them.
                This is because he works for pay and has no concern for the sheep.
                I am the good shepherd,
                and I know mine and mine know me,
                just as the Father knows me and I know the Father;</p>
