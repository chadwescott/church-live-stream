            <p>Beloved:
                See what love the Father has bestowed on us
                that we may be called the children of God.
                Yet so we are.
                The reason the world does not know us
                is that it did not know him.
                Beloved, we are Godâ€™s children now;
                what we shall be has not yet been revealed.
                We do know that when it is revealed we shall be like him,
                for we shall see him as he is.</p>
