            <p>Itâ€™s still not too late to get your SOS Daily Cash Raffle tickets. They can be picked up in the church
                entrance and in the parish office during office hours.</p>
            <p>We are grateful to everyone who have kept their weekly offerings current and pray that you continue to do
                so. In order for us to resume our ministries and programs upon reopening, we need everyone to contribute
                to our Sunday offering.</p>
            <p>Sunday envelopes and food donations can be dropped off outside the parish life center on Mondays,
                Wednesdays and Thursdays from 9-12. The food cupboard is open and in need of donations. Please check our
                bulletin for the needed item of the week. </p>
