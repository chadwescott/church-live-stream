            <p>I tell you, brothers and sisters, the time is running out.
                From now on, let those having wives act as not having them,
                those weeping as not weeping,
                those rejoicing as not rejoicing,
                those buying as not owning,
                those using the world as not using it fully.
                For the world in its present form is passing away.</p>
