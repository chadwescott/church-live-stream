            <p>After John had been arrested,
                Jesus came to Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God:
                “This is the time of fulfillment.
                The kingdom of God is at hand.
                Repent, and believe in the gospel.”</p>
            <p>As he passed by the Sea of Galilee,
                he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting their nets into the sea;
                they were fishermen.
                Jesus said to them,
                “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.”</p>
