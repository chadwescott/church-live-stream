            <p>The word of the LORD came to Jonah, saying:
                “Set out for the great city of Nineveh,
                and announce to it the message that I will tell you.”
                So Jonah made ready and went to Nineveh,
                according to the LORD’S bidding.
                Now Nineveh was an enormously large city;
                it took three days to go through it.
                Jonah began his journey through the city,
                and had gone but a single day’s walk announcing,
                “Forty days more and Nineveh shall be destroyed, “
                when the people of Nineveh believed God;</p>
