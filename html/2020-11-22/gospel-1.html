                <p>Jesus said to his disciples:
                    "When the Son of Man comes in his glory,
                    and all the angels with him,
                    he will sit upon his glorious throne,
                    and all the nations will be assembled before him.
                    And he will separate them one from another,
                    as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
                    He will place the sheep on his right and the goats on his left.
                    Then the king will say to those on his right,
                    'Come, you who are blessed by my Father.
                    Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
                    For I was hungry and you gave me food,</p>
