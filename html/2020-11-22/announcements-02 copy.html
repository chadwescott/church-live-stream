                <p>Celebrate the holiday season by remembering or honoring a special person, with a light on St.
                    Theodore’s “Lights of Love” Tree. A contribution of $5 will illuminate one of the lights on the
                    “Lights of Love” Tree. The lights will shine brightly every night from December 5, 2020 to January
                    3, 2021, the Feast of the Epiphany. Forms are in this week’s bulletin and available in the back of

                <p>It’s still not too late to get your SOS Daily Cash Raffle tickets. They can be picked up in the
