                <p>We are at 18% of our CMA goal. If you have not mailed in your pledge yet, please do so. Everyone’s
                    help is needed in order to meet our goal.</p>
                <p>On Sunday, December 6 from 2-3:30 p.m. we will be having an outdoor Christmas event for families with
                    activities and social distance visits with St. Nicholas and Santa Claus. Be sure to check out the
                    bulletin for more details and a registration form. We do have an alternative plan in the event we
                    cannot gather together, so be sure to register by November 30.</p>
                <p>Celebrate the holiday season by remembering or honoring a special person, with a light on St.
                    Theodore’s “Lights of Love” Tree. A contribution of $5 will illuminate one of the lights on the
                    “Lights of Love” Tree. The lights will shine brightly every night from December 5, 2020 to January
                    3, 2021, the Feast of the Epiphany. Forms are in this week’s bulletin and available in the back of
                    church or parish office. The deadline has been extended to November 27.</p>
                <p>It’s still not too late to get your SOS Daily Cash Raffle tickets. They can be picked up in the
                    church entrance and in the parish office during office hours.</p>
