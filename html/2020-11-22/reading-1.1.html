                <p>Thus says the Lord GOD:
                    I myself will look after and tend my sheep.
                    As a shepherd tends his flock
                    when he finds himself among his scattered sheep,
                    so will I tend my sheep.
                    I will rescue them from every place where they were scattered
                    when it was cloudy and dark.
                    I myself will pasture my sheep;
                    I myself will give them rest, says the Lord GOD.
                    The lost I will seek out,
                    the strayed I will bring back,
                    the injured I will bind up,
                    the sick I will heal,</p>
