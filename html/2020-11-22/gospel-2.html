                <p>I was thirsty and you gave me drink,
                    a stranger and you welcomed me,
                    naked and you clothed me,
                    ill and you cared for me,
                    in prison and you visited me.’
                    Then the righteous will answer him and say,
                    'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you,
                    or thirsty and give you drink?
                    When did we see you a stranger and welcome you,
                    or naked and clothe you?
                    When did we see you ill or in prison, and visit you?’
                    And the king will say to them in reply,
                    'Amen, I say to you, whatever you did
                    for one of the least brothers of mine, you did for me.’</p>
