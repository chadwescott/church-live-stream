                <p>Brothers and sisters:
                    Christ has been raised from the dead,
                    the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
                    For since death came through man,
                    the resurrection of the dead came also through man.
                    For just as in Adam all die,
                    so too in Christ shall all be brought to life,
                    but each one in proper order:
                    Christ the firstfruits;
                    then, at his coming, those who belong to Christ;
                    then comes the end,
                    when he hands over the kingdom to his God and Father,
                    when he has destroyed every sovereignty</p>
