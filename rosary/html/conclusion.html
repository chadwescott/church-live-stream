                    Let us pray: O God, whose Only Begotten Son,
                    by his life, Death, and Resurrection,
                    has purchased for us the rewards of eternal life,
                    grant, we beseech thee,
                    that while meditating on these mysteries
                    of the most holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary,
                    we may imitate what they contain
                    and obtain what they promise,
                    through the same Christ our Lord. Amen.</div>
