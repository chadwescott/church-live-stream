                    our Life, our Sweetness, and our hope.
                    To thee we cry,
                    poor banished children of Eve.
                    To thee we send up our sighs, mourning and weeping
                    in this valley of tears.
                    Turn then most gracious advocate,
                    Thine eyes of mercy toward us,
                    and after this, our exile, show unto us,
                    the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
                    O clement, O loving,
                    O sweet Virgin Mary.
                    Pray for us O Holy Mother of God,
                    That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
                    Amen.</div>
